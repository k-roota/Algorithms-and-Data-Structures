# Algorithms and Data Structures
There you can find some of algorithms written by me during laboratories at the university. Each folder represents solution to another problem. If it applies to graphs, "Graph" library created by the lecturer is used. Some folders contain "task" file describing the problem. If they don't, the issue is described in code comments.
